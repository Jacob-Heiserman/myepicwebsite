<center> <h1> Hello! I’m JP, a trumpeter, developer, and student </h1> </center>
</p><h2> If I Could Start Any Business… </h2>
I would start a game development company because I have always loved playing and making games. I would hire tons of talented people to come and work on whatever games come to mind.</p>

</p><h2> What do I want out of my life? </h2>
I want to make games so that people around the world can have fun playing them. I also wanna get really, really good at it to the point where I could teach others.</p>

I will obtain these goals by starting early and studying hard so that I can get into the business as soon as possible.</p>
